'''
In simple terms, range() allows user to generate a series of numbers within a given range.
Depending on how many arguments user is passing to the function,
user can decide where that series of numbers will begin and end


start: integer starting from which the sequence of integers is to be returned
stop: integer before which the sequence of integers is to be returned.
        The range of integers end at stop â€“ 1.
step: integer value which determines the increment between each integer in the sequence

'''
range() function only works with the integers i.e. whole numbers.
All argument must be integers.

User can not pass a string or float number or any other type in a start,
stop and step argument of a range().

All three arguments can be positive or negative.

The step value must not be zero. If a step is zero python raises a ValueError exception.

In Python, range() is a type

User can access items in a range() by index, just as user do with a list
